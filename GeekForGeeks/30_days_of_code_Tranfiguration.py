# Professor McGonagall teaches transfiguration at Hogwarts. She has given Harry the task of changing himself into a cat. She explains that the trick is to analyze your own DNA and change it into the DNA of a cat. The transfigure spell can be used to pick any one character from the DNA string, remove it and insert it in the beginning. 
# Help Harry calculates minimum number of times he needs to use the spell to change himself into a cat.

# Example 1:

# Input: 
# A = "GEEKSFORGEEKS" 
# B = "FORGEEKSGEEKS"
# Output: 3
# Explanation:The conversion can take place 
# in 3 operations:
# 1. Pick 'R' and place it at the front, 
#   A="RGEEKSFOGEEKS"
# 2. Pick 'O' and place it at the front, 
#   A="ORGEEKSFGEEKS"
# 3. Pick 'F' and place it at the front, 
#   A="FORGEEKSGEEKS"
# Example 2:

# Input: 
# A = "ABC" 
# B = "BCA"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The conversion can take place 
# in 2 operations:
# 1. Pick 'C' and place it at the front, 
#   A = "CAB"
# 2. Pick 'B' and place it at the front, 
#   A = "BCA"
# Your Task:  
# You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function transfigure() which takes strings A and B as input parameters and returns the minimum number of spells needed. If it is not possible to convert A to B then return -1.

# Expected Time Complexity: O(max(|A|, |B|))
# Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

# Constraints:
# 1 â‰¤ |A|, |B| â‰¤ 105
# A and B consists of lowercase and uppercase letters of english alphabet only.

        if A==B: return 0 #strings are same
        if len(A)!=len(B): return -1 # strings are not with equal length
